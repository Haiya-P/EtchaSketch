We are coding a raspberry pi to display an etch-a-sketch. When you move the joystick left, right, down, or up, the dot follows and draws a color. The dot starts as the color white. If you press the
joystick down, the colors change from white, to red, to green, to blue. When you shake the pi, the screen should clear and the user is good to color once
again.
